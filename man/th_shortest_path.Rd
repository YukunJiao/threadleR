\title{Calculate the shortest path length between two nodes
`th_shortest_path()` computes the shortest path length from `node1id` to
`node2id` in a Threadle network. By default, the computation uses all layers
in the network. If `layername` is provided, the shortest path is computed
using only that specific layer.}
\usage{
th_shortest_path(network, node1id, node2id, layername)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{A `threadle_network` object or a character string giving
the name of a network in the Threadle CLI environment.}

\item{node1id}{Node ID of the first vertex in the dyad.}

\item{node2id}{Node ID of the second vertex in the dyad.}

\item{layername}{Optional layer name. If omitted or empty, all layers are used.}
}
\value{
An integer giving the shortest path length.
}
\description{
Note that shortest path measures are directional: for directed layers, the
shortest path from `node1id` to `node2id` may differ from the shortest path
from `node2id` to `node1id`. For undirected (symmetric) layers, directionality
is moot.
}
\details{
If no path exists from `node1id` to `node2id` under the specified layer
selection, the backend returns `-1` to indicate that the target is unreachable.
