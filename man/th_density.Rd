\title{Graph density}
\usage{
th_density(network, layername)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{A Threadle network object or the name of a network variable.}

\item{layername}{Name of the layer (string or Threadle string variable) for
which to compute density.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the layer density.
}
\description{
Computes the density of a layer in a Threadle network by calling the Threadle
CLI command `density(network=..., layername=...)`.
}
\details{
#' Density is returned as a numeric scalar, typically defined as the ratio of the
number of observed edges to the maximum possible number of edges for a simple
graph (i.e., assuming no multi-edges). The exact treatment of self-loops and
directionality follows Threadle's `density` implementation.
