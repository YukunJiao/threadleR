\title{Calculate density of a layer}
\usage{
th_density(network, layername)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{A `threadle_network` object or a character string giving
the name of a network in the Threadle CLI environment.}

\item{layername}{Layer name.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the layer density.
}
\description{
`th_density()` computes the density of a layer in a Threadle network.
}
\details{
Density is returned as a numeric scalar, typically defined as the ratio of the
number of observed edges to the maximum possible number of edges for a simple
graph (i.e., assuming no multi-edges). The exact treatment of self-loops and
directionality follows Threadle's `density` implementation.
